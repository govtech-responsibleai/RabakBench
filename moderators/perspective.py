Perspective API

6 different attriÃŸbutes of toxicity:
TOXICITY: A rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion.
SEVERE_TOXICITY: A very hateful, aggressive, disrespectful comment or otherwise very likely to make a user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective. This attribute is much less sensitive to more mild forms of toxicity, such as comments that include positive uses of curse words.
IDENTITY_ATTACK: Negative or hateful comments targeting someone because of their identity.
INSULT: Insulting, inflammatory, or negative comment towards a person or a group of people.
PROFANITY: Swear words, curse words, or other obscene or profane language.
THREAT: Describes an intention to inflict pain, injury, or violence against an individual or group.
